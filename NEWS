* modify sin_cell_order_iter(): output log likelihood at each iteration

* modify sin_cell_ordering_class(): change num_iter to num_shuffle. There are three constraints
     in model convergence: number of iterations, number of times shuffle cell time labels,
     and percent increase in log-likelihood. In each iteration, we shuffle the cell time labels
     num_shuffle times. After each iteration, we evaluate percent increase in log-likelihood and
     continue to iterate until percent increase in log-likelihood is smaller than specified or
     until the number of iterations reached the default maximum.
